# Scraping Booli for Stockholm House Prices

## Overview

This project is designed to scrape historical house prices for apartments with 1, 2, 3, and 4 rooms in the Stockholm area using Booli's (unofficial) backend API. The data is then analyzed in Jupyter Notebooks to explore patterns and trends.

**Warning:**  
The scraper relies on Booli's internal API, which is unofficial and may change or break at any time.
